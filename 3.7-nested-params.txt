NESTED PARAMS
Now that we have the proper route, we need to make sure the weapons controller properly looks up both the zombie and the weapon when we request /zombies/2/weapons/1. Finish this controller:

class WeaponsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @zombie =
    @weapon =
  end
end


# Here is the parameters hash sent into the controller
params = { zombie_id: 2, id: 1 }
view rawparams.rb hosted with ❤ by GitHub


class Zombie < ActiveRecord::Base
has_many :weapons
end
view rawzombie.rb hosted with ❤ by GitHub


class Weapon < ActiveRecord::Base
belongs_to :zombie
end
view rawweapon.rb hosted with ❤ by GitHub

The id for the zombie will come from params[:zombie_id]
You can find a weapon for a zombie, like this
@zombie.weapons.find(<id>)

The correct answer

class WeaponsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @zombie = Zombie.find(params[:zombie_id])
    @weapon = @zombie.weapons.find(params[:id])
  end
end
