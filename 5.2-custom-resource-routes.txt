CUSTOM RESOURCE ROUTES
Create two custom member routes on the weapons resource, so you have a put method called toggle_condition and a put method called reload.

RailsForZombies::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies do
    resources :weapons
  end
end


To add routes to the :weapons resource pass a block, like this:
resources :weapons do
  # custom routes go here
end
To add a custom route, call the HTTP method and then pass in the name, like this:
resources :weapons do
  put :toggle_condition, on: :member
end
The correct answer should be:
RailsForZombies::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies do
    resources :weapons do
      put :toggle_condition, on: :member
      put :reload, on: :member
    end
  end
end
