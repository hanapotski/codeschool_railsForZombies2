FOREIGN KEY
OH NO! Our Database Admin turned into a Zombie and decided to rename the belongs_to field in our locations table tweeter_id instead of the intelligent default tweet_id. We're going to slay him and correct this, but in the meantime set the foreign_key on both relationships to tweeter_id. Also set the dependency so when a tweet is destroyed, the location is destroyed as well.

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :location, foreign_key: :tweeter_id, dependent: :destroy
end

class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :tweet, foreign_key: :tweeter_id
end
