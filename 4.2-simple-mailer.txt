SIMPLE MAILER
Code up the low_ammo mailer with the subject of "#{weapon.name} has low ammo", the email should be sent to the zombie.email. Lastly, set the default from address for all emails in WeaponMailer to admin@rfz.com

class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
  end
end


Make sure to check out the ActionMailer Basics Guide.
To add default settings to a mailer, use the default class method, like this:
class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "admin@rfz.com"
The correct answer is:
class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "admin@rfz.com"

  def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
    mail to: zombie.email, subject: "#{weapon.name} has low ammo"
  end
end
