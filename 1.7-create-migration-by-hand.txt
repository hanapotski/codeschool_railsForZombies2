CREATE MIGRATION BY HAND
Create migration by hand that adds two fields to the tweets table: a location string field which has a limit of 30 and a boolean field called show_location which defaults to false.

class AddLocationToTweets < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :tweets, :location, :string, limit: 30
    add_column :tweets, :show_location, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
