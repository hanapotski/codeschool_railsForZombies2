ATTACHING A FILE
Change the low_ammo method to include a picture of the weapon that's low on ammo as an attachment. You can name the file weapon.jpg and load the file using weapon.picture_file.

class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "admin@rfz.com"

  def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
    mail to: zombie.email, subject: "#{weapon.name} has low ammo"
  end
end


Give an email an attachment by assigning a file the attachments hash
In this case, weapon.picture_file can be directly assigned to an attachment
The correct answer should be:
class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "admin@rfz.com"

  def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
    attachments["weapon.jpg"] = weapon.picture_file
    mail to: zombie.email, subject: "#{weapon.name} has low ammo"
  end
end
