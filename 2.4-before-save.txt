BEFORE SAVE
Create a before_save callback that checks to see if a tweet has a location, if it does have a location then set show_location to true.
Tip: You can check to see if location exists with if self.location?

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_save :has_location

  def has_location
    if self.location?
      self.show_location = true
    end
  end

end
