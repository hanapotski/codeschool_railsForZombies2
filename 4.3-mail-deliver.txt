MAIL DELIVERY
Finish coding the check_ammo method on the Weapon model so when we have exactly three ammo left, it will send out the low_ammo mailer we just created.

class Weapon < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :zombie

  before_save :check_ammo

  def check_ammo

  end
end


class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
default from: "admin@rfz.com"
def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
mail to: zombie.email, subject: "#{weapon.name} has low ammo"
end
end
view rawweapon_mailer.rb hosted with ❤ by GitHub

Make sure to check out the ActionMailer Basics Guide.
Make sure and pass in the weapon and the zombie to the low_ammo mailer, like this:
WeaponMailer.low_ammo(self, self.zombie)
The correct answer should be:
class Weapon < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :zombie

  before_save :check_ammo

  def check_ammo
    if ammo == 3
      WeaponMailer.low_ammo(self, self.zombie).deliver
    end
  end
end
