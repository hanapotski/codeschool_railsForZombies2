HAS ONE
Instead of storing location inside the Tweet model, let's instead break it out into a separate table (as you see below). In this case we want to define that a Tweet can have one Location, and a Location belongs to a Tweet. Fill out the models below accordingly.

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :location
end

class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :tweet
end
