HAS MANY THROUGH
Now that we have our new tables, it's time to define the relationships between each of the models. Define the has_many through relationships in the Tweet & Category model and the belongs_to relationships in the Categorization model.

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :categorizations
  has_many :categories, through: :categorizations
end

class Categorization < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :tweet
  belongs_to :category
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :categorizations
  has_many :tweets, through: :categorizations
end
