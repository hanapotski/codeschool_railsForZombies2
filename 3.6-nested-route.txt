NESTED ROUTE
Write the nested route that will allow us to nest tweets and weapons under the zombie resource. The idea here is that a zombie has many tweets and zombie has many weapons.

RailsForZombies::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies
  resources :tweets
  resources :weapons
end

Resources are nested, like this
resources :<parent resource> do
  resources :<child resource>
end

The correct answer

RailsForZombies::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies do
    resources :tweets, :weapons
  end
end
